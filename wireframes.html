        <h1>Neurons transmit information to one another through electrochemical signals</h1>
        <p>They make up the motor nerves that allow you to type an essay, the sensory nerves that let you feel a fluffy dog, and
        your brain, allowing to remember the content of this module. They have a number of helper cells, ranging from
        astrocytes, to microglia, to ependymal cells as well. You will come to appreciate the structure and function of neurons
        and the comrade cells which help to maintain the optimal function of the nervous system.</p>
